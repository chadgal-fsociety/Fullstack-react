        Saurabh Kumar is 30. He doesn’t have an IPL contract, and used those two months bowling at a single stump in Ghaziabad. In the last few years, he has been consistent for Uttar Pradesh and India A, and is fifth in the pecking order after Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav to get into the Indian Test team.<br>

On the other hand, Nishant Sindhu, at 19, is already a World Cup (U-19) winner, and got a fat IPL contract with Chennai Super Kings. Although he didn’t play a single match, he trained with MS Dhoni and received valuable tips from his childhood hero Jadeja.<br>

Both Saurabh and Nishant took different career paths. Kumar used to travel to Delhi from Baghpat every day, a two-and-half-hour train journey, while Sindhu’s residence was close to Shri Ram Narain Cricket Academy, run by former Haryana first-class cricketer and coach Ashwani Kumar. But the two have one similarity, they are conventional left-arm spinners, a rare species on the Indian domestic circuit.<br>
