        As I watched Satyaprem ki Katha, starring Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani, I was torn between two thoughts. One was genuine admiration for director Sameer Vidwans and writer Karan Shrikant Sharma who raise the crucial issue of how ‘no means no’ even if the woman has been physically intimate with you to any degree on an earlier occasion. A lack of consent is never a grey area. But another part of me wondered why they chose two regressive and quite frankly toxic narrative tropes to convey this otherwise progressive idea.<br><br>
        The fact that so many of us didn’t even question this speaks to a larger social mindset where helping women or simply being supportive is a means to greatness for men. Perhaps it stems from the all the fairy tales we read where princesses are literally sleeping or trapped in towers till a prince comes along and rescues them. Or it’s rooted in mythology because Sita waited for Ram to come and rescue her, and Draupadi was saved from being disrobed by Krishna who created an unending sari during the vastraharan. Maybe it’s because gods, prophets or spiritual heads in other major religions are all male too. This cultural baggage plus a very low benchmark for what makes a ‘good man’ or a good husband, put men on pedestals for basic human decency.<br><br>
        A thoughtful and sensitive partner who offers unconditional love is a boon, but in the year 2023 we need to let go of the idea that marriage is the means to a better life, or that men in general are meant to rescue women from their problems. Let Katha have her own katha, while Sattu just offers his Satyaprem (true love).<br>
